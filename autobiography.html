        <h2>This is My Life</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Kieth Bryan Cervantes Mallari, and this is the story of my life—a simple and ordinary journey filled with small moments that shaped who I am today.
        </p>
        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>
            I was born in the Philippines and raised in a humble, loving family. Life wasn’t perfect, but it was peaceful. My parents taught me values like respect, hard work, and humility. From a young age, I was curious, observant, and content with the little joys in life.
        </p>
        <h3>Elementary Days</h3>
        <p>
            My elementary life was filled with innocent fun and learning. I studied at a nearby public school and met my first friends. I wasn’t the smartest in class, but I did my best. I joined school programs and enjoyed recess with classmates. Field trips and Christmas parties were especially memorable.
            <br>
            My concerns were simple: homework, projects, and chores at home. Yet, every day felt like an adventure—these years built the foundation of my personality.
        </p>
        <h3>High School Life</h3>
        <p>
            High school brought challenges and memories. I started to understand myself and the world more. There was academic pressure, friendship excitement, and the confusion of growing up. I wasn’t a star student, but I always aimed to learn and pass.
            <br>
            Joys included school fairs, intramurals, group projects, and bonding with friends. Tough times came with low grades, misunderstandings, and self-doubt. Each experience helped me grow. High school taught me that life isn’t always easy, but every struggle has a purpose.
        </p>
        <h3>College Journey</h3>
        <p>
            Now, I’m studying at Heroes Memorial College, taking up Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT). College is both exciting and intimidating: more responsibilities, harder subjects, and a bigger step toward the real world.
            <br>
            I’ve met new people, faced late-night studying, and challenging projects. I’ve learned about time management, found new friendships, developed new skills, and started to discover my future path.
            <br>
            College life is teaching me independence and responsibility. I know now that success takes patience, effort, and sacrifice.
